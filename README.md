# 📚 Learning BGR (Bandgap Reference) Design — Progress Log

This repository documents my learning journey for designing **Bandgap References (BGR)**.  
I am following the lectures by **Hafeez KT** on YouTube and implementing key concepts in **LTspice**.

## ✍️ Topics Covered So Far

### 1. Introduction to BGR
- What is a Bandgap Reference?
- Why do we need a voltage source independent of **temperature** and **supply variations**?

### 2. Applications of BGR
- Used in **ADCs**, **DACs**, **Voltage Regulators**, **Oscillators**, and **Temperature Sensors**.

### 3. Industry Standard Variations
- **Temperature Range**: -40 °C to +125 °C (automotive and industrial standards).
- **Supply Voltage Variation**: Typically ±10–20% (depends on application).

### 4. Types of Temperature Variations
- **CTAT**: Complementary To Absolute Temperature → Decreases with temperature.
- **PTAT**: Proportional To Absolute Temperature → Increases with temperature.
- **ZTAT**: Zero Temperature Coefficient → Net effect is flat (constant with temperature).

> **Goal:** Combine CTAT and PTAT effects appropriately to achieve ZTAT (i.e., temperature-independent voltage).

### 5. Core Concept of Bandgap Generation
Block diagram and formula:
\[
V_{\text{BGR}} = \alpha_1 \times V_{\text{PTAT}} + \alpha_2 \times V_{\text{CTAT}}
\]
where
- \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) are scaling factors.

Diagram:  
*(You can add this simple block diagram)*  
```
 V_PTAT → α1 Gain → +
                       \
                        → Summer → V_BGR
                       /
V_CTAT → α2 Gain → -
```

## 🔥 Deep Dive into CTAT Generation

### a. Understanding CTAT Behavior
- Voltage across a **diode** (or a diode-connected BJT) **decreases with temperature**.
- Used a **constant current source** (assumed ideal: temperature and supply independent).
- CTAT voltage:
  \[
  V_{BE}(T) = V_{BE}(T_0) - \Delta V_{BE}
  \]
where the slope was theoretically derived as approximately **-1.6 mV/°C**.

### b. Modeling a Diode in CMOS Process
- A **parasitic BJT** is formed between:
  - Collector → n-well
  - Base → p-substrate (grounded)
  - Emitter → n+ diffusion (grounded)
- Practical BJT used to model a "diode" in CMOS (since diodes are not separately available).

Diagram:  

```
      Vout (Collector)

GND ---|  NPN BJT (diode-connected)
       |\
        |
       GND (Emitter, Base)
```

## 🛠️ Simulation Work (LTspice)

- Designed the schematic using a **current source** feeding a **diode-connected BJT**.
- Swept the **temperature** using:
  ```plaintext
  .step temp -40 125 1
  ```

- **Obtained the CTAT curve** showing a negative slope with temperature.

### 📈 CTAT Curve
- Voltage vs Temperature plot.
- Theoretical slope: ~**-1.6 mV/°C**.

## 🧠 Key Observations

- The slope is measured in **mV/°C**, and is **equally valid as mV/K** (since 1 K = 1 °C change).
- CTAT voltage decreases approximately linearly with increasing temperature.
- Important to model **current sources** properly if moving toward real designs (IPCC sources).

Would you like me to also generate a simple **block diagram image** (using graphical tools) and a **template for folder organization** for your GitHub repo?  
It'll make your repo even more professional 📂✨.
