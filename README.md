# 📚 Learning BGR (Bandgap Reference) Design — Progress Log

This repository documents my learning journey into designing **Bandgap References (BGR)**, based on lectures by **Hafeez KT** and practical implementation using **LTspice**.

---

## 🔧 Block Diagram Overview

A **Bandgap Reference** is a temperature-independent voltage source, critical in analog and mixed-signal circuits.

### 🧠 Conceptual Block Diagram

```
 V_PTAT → α1 Gain → +
                       \
                        → Summer → V_BGR
                       /
V_CTAT → α2 Gain → -
```

## 📝 What is a Bandgap Reference?

A **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** provides a stable voltage (typically \~1.2 V) that is **independent of temperature, supply voltage**, and **process variations**.

### 📌 Applications of BGR:

* Analog-to-Digital Converters (**ADCs**)
* Digital-to-Analog Converters (**DACs**)
* Voltage Regulators
* Oscillators
* Temperature Sensors

## 🌡️ Industry Standard Variations

| Parameter             | Typical Range     |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Temperature**       | –40 °C to +125 °C |
| **Supply Variations** | ±10% to ±20%      |

These are especially critical in **automotive and industrial** environments.

## 📈 Temperature Dependencies

### CTAT – *Complementary to Absolute Temperature*

* **Decreases with temperature**
* Example: $V_{BE}$ of a diode or BJT

### PTAT – *Proportional to Absolute Temperature*

* **Increases with temperature**
* Typically generated using differences in $V_{BE}$

### ZTAT – *Zero Temperature Coefficient*

* **Flat/constant with temperature**
* Achieved by combining CTAT and PTAT

---

## ⚙️ How We Generate a Constant Voltage (BGR)

We combine the CTAT and PTAT voltages in such a way that their **temperature dependencies cancel out**, resulting in a stable **ZTAT voltage**.

$$
V_{\text{BGR}} = \alpha_1 \cdot V_{\text{PTAT}} + \alpha_2 \cdot V_{\text{CTAT}}
$$

* $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$: scaling factors, adjusted to cancel temperature effects.

### 📊 Typical Graphs

*(These will be added visually in the repo)*

* **CTAT Curve**: Downward slope (\~–1.6 mV/°C)
* **PTAT Curve**: Upward slope
* **ZTAT/BGR**: Nearly flat line

## 🧪 CTAT Generation — Circuit Insight

### 🔋 Circuit

A **constant current source** biases a **diode-connected BJT**:

```
      Vout (Collector)
         |
         |
       |/
GND ---|  NPN BJT (diode-connected)
       |\
        |
       GND (Emitter, Base)
```

This voltage acts as **CTAT**, as it decreases with increasing temperature.

### 📐 Equation for Diode Voltage Temp. Dependence:

$$
\frac{dV_D}{dT} = \frac{V_D - V_T(4+m) - \frac{E_g}{q}}{T}
$$

From literature:

$$
\frac{dV_D}{dT} \approx -1.66\,\text{mV/K}
$$

## 🏗️ Implementing a PN Junction Diode in CMOS

Since standalone diodes are not available in CMOS, we use a **parasitic BJT**:

* **Collector** → n-well
* **Base** → p-substrate (grounded)
* **Emitter** → n+ diffusion (grounded)

This behaves like a **diode-connected BJT**, suitable for CTAT voltage generation.

## 📷 Schematic & Simulation (LTspice)

* **Setup**: Constant current source feeding a diode-connected BJT

* **Temperature Sweep**:

  ```
  .step temp -40 125 1
  ```

## 🧠 Key Observations

* CTAT and PTAT curves must be carefully balanced for optimal BGR.
* In practice, **IPCC current sources** are used instead of ideal ones.
* The **temperature coefficient** of the diode voltage closely matches theory.
